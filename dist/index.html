      Happy Mothers Day

        First of all, Mom, I love you more than anything. You sacrificed so much at an early age to make me the man I am today. The crazy stories you have told me about your youth are insane. What's even more insane is how you overcame all of the craziness
        to become the woman and mother you are today. You are a very strong, independent woman and have worked your butt off to provide for Alex and I for so many years. I'm so proud of your accomplishments at work and in life in general. I will never forget
        all of the vacations, road trips, and flash light tags in the woods and I can't wait to share those same experiences with Kennedy. You are the reason that I am so fun, outgoing, and hilarious. Those are my three favorite things about myself and I owe
        it all to you. I couldn't ask for a better Jamma to spend time with my daughter. I know that she will get those same attributes from you that I did and that will warm my heart. The other day, at my birthday party, I started to cry when I watched you
        and her make animal noises while reading. You are exactly what I want in a grandma and I'm glad that Kennedy is going to be as lucky as I am. Our nights out on the town together with my friends, are sometimes few and far between but they have to be
        because no human being can handle that much awesome. As you've watched me grow throughout my life I've also had my eye on you. I've seen all of the problems and struggles that you've had to overcome to create the life you have now. I am proud to call
        you my mother and I couldn't be any luckier. I hope you have a wonderful Mother's Day and I love you very much forever and always.
